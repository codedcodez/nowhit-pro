                        Our mining term is very short so we do not charge any maintenance fee or any other hidden fee. The only thing is because the value of bitcoin is very volatile so we advice our customers to deposit a little above what is required so that when the value of bitcoin drops or reduces, your mining will not be affected.
                        Our mining is 100% transparent.<br><br>

                        Yes, our referral program pays 20% commission on every bitcoin your referral mined. This is very lucrative especially if you have many referrals mining actively since our mining pays really high. But our referral program is only currently available for those who buy one or more packages from us.<br><br>

                        Our system will reject any low payment. With this in mind, it is advisable to pay a little higher than the minimum fee always to avoid drops due to bitcoin liquidity.<br><br>
